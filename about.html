		<h1>About the Hackathon </h1>
		<p>The Pittsburgh Challenge was initially created with the hope that technological innovations could lead to improvements in healthcare. The Hackathon offers many different possible tracks, allowing the participants to create projects that could impact the entire healthcare field overall. The challenge requires students from all different backgrounds, to work together, apply their own knowledge, experience, and expertise. </p>
		
		<p>Our team is composed of members: Julietta Allart, Matias Badino, Hannah Kuklinski, Yu-hsuan Chao
		<br>Julietta Allart- delegated tasks, dealt with APIs, assisted in troubleshooting
		<br>Matias Badino - created the python codes, dealt with the APIs, assisted in troubleshooting
		<br>Hannah Kuklinski- Compiled, sorted, and organized data on the types of allergens in a CSV file.
		<br>She also wrote the code for the about page, the HTML/CSS coding for the website (the original one was sadly lost due to issues with GitHub savings :(  ) 
		<br>Yu-hsuan Chao- preliminary research on RCR systems </p>
		
		<p>What is the problem our team members aimed to solve with our project? </p>
		<br>There is often much confusion about the true ingredients that are found in many of the foods that we love and eat almost every single day. Since the start of food innovation and creation, new ingredients, preservatives, chemicals, natural flavorings, and much more were added to our foods to improve the taste and decrease the production cost. In some instances, these other ingredients may be a hidden trigger to certain allergies. Allergies are the result of damaged DNA and the inability to process certain types of proteins that are found in other foods, animals, or in nature. Allergies are a serious matter and require extreme caution and care when consuming different types of food. However, if there is an ingredient that is-  a lesser known derivative of a known allergen, or a different food item that is a possible trigger- found in these foods, it could be potentially harmful. 
		<p>What technologies or tools did you use to develop your project
		<br> In our project, we used HTML, JSS, Python, APIs- google, openai, national library of medicine. </p>
		
		<p>Were there any challenges while completing this project? 
		<br>Absolutely. I personally strugged with using a repository for the first time. While my groupmates were making commits and pushing files into the repo, I was faced with multiple error messages about a failed pull statement and ended up creating 4 nested repositories. This ended up merging the old projects with the new and we were unable to determine what the newer code was. </p>
		
		<p>Valuable lessons learned during this project?
		<br>I learned to be patient with yourself when you are new to coding because error messages can be a bit discouraging, but it's part of the process. I also learned that it is important to save your file to the right folder and not to create new folders by accident :/
